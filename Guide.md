## Introduction

The scheduling utility is the brain child of Dr. Albert Schwarzkopf in an attempt to make the scheduling process at the University of Oklahoma more intuitive and easier to digest. The project was initially developed by Austin Shinpaugh. This document was drafted in hopes that the project will continue to evolve after his graduation. 

The author of the document developed this on OSX and used Homebrew as his package manager. If the next author(s) use another Unix distro then keep in mind that the package manager cli commands will change. For example:

Mac | Unix
--- | ---
`brew install git` | `sudo apt-get install git`

Check your manual for further information based on your distro. In Unix to see if you already have a dependency installed (and if it’s in your PATH environment variable) type:  
`which <dependency>`

This project was developed with [Symfony](https://symfony.com/), a common Model-View-Controller (MVC) PHP framework. It has extensive [documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html) available online. This document is intended to combine knowledge from several sources and provided as a general guide.

## Installation

### Basics
Open up the Terminal and download your project dependencies:  
`brew install git`  
`brew install mysql`  
`brew install php56 php56-opcache php56-yaml php56-igbinary php56-mcrypt`  
`brew install httpd24`  
`brew install composer`  
Install in one line:  
`brew install git mysql php56 php56-opcache php56-yaml php56-igbinary php56-mcrypt httpd24 composer`

Several of these will require a first-time setup. It’s recommended you refrain from changing as many defaults as possible.

### Project Setup

#### Part 1: Project setup
Change Directory (CD) into where you’ll be working on the project.  
`cd /Users/ashinpaugh/development/`

Next download the project:  
`git clone schedule git@github.com:ashinpaugh/schedule.git`  
`cd schedule`

The output of pwd is what we will refer to as the Project’s Root Folder (PRF):
`pwd`

Next verify that your basic dependencies are installed correctly, make changes as suggested.  
`php bin/symfony_requirements`

Install the project’s PHP dependencies:  
`composer install`

Next setup the project’s SQL structure:  
`php bin/console doctrine:database:create`
`php bin/console doctrine:schema:create`

Next install the project’s assets into the <Project’s Root Folder>/web directory:  
`php bin/console assetic:dump`

#### Part 2: Server Configuration and Host entry
Setup your Apache Virtual Host (Mac):  
`vim /usr/local/etc/apache2/2.4/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf`

For Unix (creates a new file):  
`sudo vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/scheduler.conf`

Insert the following:
```xml
<VirtualHost *:80>
   ServerAdmin  yourEmail@example.com
   ServerName   scheduler.dev

   SetEnv   APPLICATION_ENV "dev"
   DocumentRoot /Library/WebServer/schedule
   <Directory "/Library/WebServer/schedule">
      DirectoryIndex    app_dev.php
      Options   MultiViews FollowSymLinks
      AllowOverride All
      Require   all granted
   </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```
For Unix, make sure that tabs are used instead of spaces.

Edit server admin to something appropriate.
ServerName will be the URL you type into your browser to access the site.
DocumentRoot see below.

The DocumentRoot can point either to a symlink you create in the WebServer folder that points to your <Project’s Root Folder>/web, or directly to <Project Root Folder>/web. Sometimes there are technical reasons for creating a symlink to that WebServer folder, but we won’t be exploring those in this document.

Edit your host file to point to home:  
`sudo vim /etc/hosts`

And paste:  
`127.0.0.1 scheduler.dev`

To get it working on Unix, I followed https://lowendbox.com/blog/how-to-setup-apache-virtual-hosts-on-ubuntu-16-04/ and
1. Remove consecutive spaces from config file (with tabs)
2. Add conf file
    `sudo a2ensite scheduler.conf`
3. Disable apache default
    `sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf`
4. Restart apache
    `sudo service apache2 restart`
5. Create the store directory
    `mkdir <project root>/var/cache/prod/http_cache`
6. Grant write access to entire var directory
    `chmod +w <project root>/var`  
I had some other issues with expectations of where a file should be. For example, I had to symlink `ln -s /usr/bin/php /usr/local/bin/php`

At this point you should be able to visit the landing page for the app at http://scheduler.dev/app_dev.php/:
![Landing Page](/landing_page.png)

Note the `/app_dev.php` at the end. This means your accessing the “dev” version of the project, which will enable the Symfony’s Web Profiler feature to give you useful information regarding the performance of the app. `/app_dev.php` also loads the “dev” config files and routing resources.

#### Part 3: Development
At this point you need to import data to work with. You can get the data by running:  
`php bin/console schedule:parse-book`

This wasn’t high optimized (it takes a while to run) as it was hoped that we would be able to hook into API’s provided by OU IT; at the time of writing this document, those have yet to surface.

From here you’re ready to start development. At this point you should familiarize yourself with Symfony’s command line. To get a list of available commands type:  
`php bin/console`  
You should see this list:
```
Symfony 3.3.8 (kernel: app, env: dev, debug: true)

  command [options] [arguments]

The author prefers [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) by JetBrains for as an IDE. A one year free trial is available through their website for students. PHPStorm has an extremely useful Symfony plugin that is highly recommend.

When editing your CSS / Javascript run the :watch command in an open terminal window to compile those assets automatically when you reload your page:  
`php bin/console assetic:watch`
